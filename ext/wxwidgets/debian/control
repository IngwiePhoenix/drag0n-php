Description: PHP bindings for the GUI Cross-platform framework wxWidgets
 wxPHP is a binding for the great cross-platform library wxWidgets used 
 to develop GUI applications. Combining the power and flexibility that 
 we have grow used to while developing for the web with PHP, and the great
 wxWidgets framework, we are striking for simpler, easier, faster and fun
 experience when programing for the desktop.
 .
 PHP5 is an HTML-embedded scripting language. Much of its syntax is borrowed
 from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features thrown
 in. The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write
 dynamically generated pages quickly.

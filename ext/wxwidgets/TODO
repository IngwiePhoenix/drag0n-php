Short term TODO
==============================

* (FIXED) Fix segmentation bug that occurs on shutdown.

* (FIXED) Check why PHP Segfaults when loading the library from the php.ini while
  loading it with dl function works as expected.

* (FIXED) fix xml_parser not using <array>[]</array> on argument types 

* (FIXED) Methods returning references to its own object return null,
  this was fixed before, but after introducing wxPHPObjectReferences
  it break up.
  
* (FIXED) Check for arguments[0] and [1] for example on 
  wxLogWindow_php::OnFrameClose(wxFrame* frame) since they are possible 
  memory leaks.

* (FIXED) Strange behaviour on wxOSX where the application receives mouse
  events correctly but not keyboard ones. I suspect of the way
  we are initliazing the wxPHP library to run applications.

* (DONE) Update config.m4 and configd.w32 to use new wxWidgets 2.9.x

* (DONE) The PHP_METHODs should have some "proto" comment. This helps 
  with some documentation tools.

* (PARTIALLY) Compilation testing and troubleshooting on windows

* (PARTIALLY) Compilation testing and troubleshooting on mac

* Implement __set to write to internal wxWidgets class properties.

* Implement compare_objects handler for wxWidget classes that implement
  operator== etc...
  
* Replace call_user_function_ex() with zend_call_method[_with_[1-3]_param[s]
  family of functions from zend_interfaces.h on virtual methods 
  (Create Custom zend_method_call with arguments array support)
  
* Use zend_parse_parameters_none() to produce a nicer error on 
  methods/functions that dont accept parameters.
  
* Don't use zend_error outside the engine, but use
  php_error_docref which gives a nicer error message.
  
* Possibly declare char _wxResource[] = "wxResource" and other char
  strings passed to functions as const.
  
* Add zend_error on event connect in case user passes wrong count of
  arguments

* Fix segmentation fault on wxGTK when no wxApp is initialized.
  
  
Long term TODO
==============================

* Approach a more object oriended style for the source maker

* Develop a modules architecture in order to use the source maker to
  generate the PHP bindings for any library with doxygen documentation.

Json Files
......................................
This directory holds the json text files, result of parsing the 
wxWidgets documentation with the xml_parser script. The files are pretty 
printed to make manual edition possible as easier integration of patches.
Previously standard php serialize functions were used making impossible 
to edit them. We thought about using the xml format but the most easier 
format to convert php arrays to human editable files was json.

Files on this directory:

	classes.json:
		Classes and it's methods with detailed information.
		
	class_groups.json:
		Defines to which group a class belongs in order to generate
		multiple source files instead of generating a single huge one.
		
	classes_variables.json
		Store the member variables of classes to be able to implement
		__get and __set
		
	consts.json 
		#define macro names and the values.
		
	enums.json
		Class enumerations and global enumerations.
		
	functions.json
		wxWidgets global functions with detailed information.
		
	global_variables.json
		Various global variables found while parsing like wx_NORMAL_FONT
		
	includes.json
		The include files of the parsed files (this include files are
		added to common.h for correct compilation)
		
	typedef.json
		Name of variables declared as typedef with 
		the original type value.
		
		
Things manually added/changed to files
......................................

This file serves as a registry of manual changes made to the generated
files by xml_parser.php. So if we need to regenerate again these files
we don't have to go to the whole process of inspecting everything
and just focus on the changes stored here.

These changes are done in order to generate the correct code
to successfully compile.

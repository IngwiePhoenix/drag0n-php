Windows Compilation Issues:
=====================================

mode_t is defined on wxWidgets and PHP at the same time

	Fix: On TSRM/tsrm_virtual_cwd.h substitute:
		
		typedef unsigned short mode_t;
		
		with
		
		#ifndef __WXMSW__
		typedef unsigned short mode_t;
		#endif
		
wxPosScriptDC Not enabled by default on wxMSW

	Fix: On wxWidgets lib\vc_lib\mswu\wx\setup.h set:
		wxUSE_POSTSCRIPT 1 
		
Linking errors where produced from some deprecated 
methods that seemed to be implemented on log.cpp but 
strangely enough are producing linking errors 

	Fix: removed the following declarations/prototypes from the wxwidgets 
		 include/wx/log.h

		wxLogFormatter::FormatTime(long)const
		wxLog::DoLog(unsigned long,wchar_t const *,long)
		wxLog::DoLog(unsigned long,char const *,long)

		
Notes:
=====================================

Here I write some methods I needed to disable since
they aren't implemented, what produces linking errors.
Should be reported to wxWidgets as a bug.

	wxRichToolTip::SetTitleFont(class wxFont const &)
	wxPoint2DDouble::SetPolarCoordinates(double,double)
	wxPoint2DInt::SetPolarCoordinates(int,int)

	
wx.rc Needed on php.exe
=======================================

It seems that some components rely on cursors and icons that need to be
embedded on the application executable, like for example wxStyledTextCtrl.
In this case the application executable is php.exe or php-win.exe

Steps to include wx.rc on these executables:

Modify: win32/build/template.rc and replace

#ifdef WANT_LOGO
0 ICON win32\build\php.ico
#endif

with

#ifdef WANT_LOGO
0 ICON win32\build\php.ico
#include <wx/msw/wx.rc>
#endif

in order to only include the wx.rc file when the system is building
the php.exe or php-win.exe.

Modify: win32/build/confutils.js and replace

$(RC)

with

$(RC) /I PATH_TO_WXWIDGETS\\include

where PATH_TO_WXWIDGETS can be C:\\wxWidgets. This is to ensure that
the resource compiler fines the file wx.rc.

If this steps are omitted the php executable will crash each time a
component that relies on some specific resources is loaded.

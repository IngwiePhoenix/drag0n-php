This directory is scanned by the xml_parser.php script on the tools
directory for the wxWidgets doxygen xml files. To generate new json
files whose are used by the code generator.

In order to generate these files you would need a trunk copy of 
wxWidgets cd into docs\doxygen and execute ./regen.sh xml, then
you would need to copy all the xml files on the out\xml directory
into this directory.

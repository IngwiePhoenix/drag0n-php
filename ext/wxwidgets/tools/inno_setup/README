Inno Setup Script
========================================================================

This directory contains an Inno Setup script file as basic necessary 
files to generate a windows setup which includes wxphp and the php 
interpreter.

The required program to compile the script.iss is Inno Setup compiler 
found at http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php Also we recommend the 
usage of InnoIDE which facilitates the edition of inno script files, 
you can download the ide at http://innoide.org. Also you will need to 
install the Inno Setup preprocessor.

The script file creates file associations for .wxphp and .wxphpd where 
.wxphp is for running scripts as normal desktop applications and .wxphpd
is for running them with the cli version of php in order to debug. The 
.wxphp extension is opened with wxphp-win.exe and .wxphpd with wxphp.exe
You would need to place the php directory on this directory as make some
other necessary changes depending on your environment.

The setup.php is included on the installation file and the purpose of 
this script is to generate the php.ini with correct extensions directory
value as the setenv.bat with correct path to php interpreter.

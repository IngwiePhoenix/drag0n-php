Introduction
========================================================================

wxPHP is a binding of wxWidgets (http://wxwidgets.org/) with the purpose 
of bringing all the rapid application development tools available on PHP 
to assist on the development of applications as the cross-platform
beauty of wxWidgets to create great Graphical User Interfaces. The 
syntax used is very similar to the one used on original implementation 
of wxWidgets C++, making it easier for people already familiar with
the library.
	



Building on Windows
========================================================================

. Requirements
	
	* Windows SDK 6.1
	* Visual C++ 2010 Express Edition
	* wxWidgets 2.8.12
	* PHP5 Sources
	* wxPHP source code
	* Read the README_MSW
	
. Install Windows SDK 6.1 and Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition

	Windows SDK 6.1 download links:
		
		Web Setup
			
			http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=11310
			
			or
			
		DVD ISO
			
			http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=F26B1AA4-741A-433A-9BE5-FA919850BDBF&displaylang=en
		
	Visual Studio 2008 Express Edition download links:
	
		http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2008-editions/express
	
. Download and install wxWidgets 2.9.4

	Checkout svn sources:
	
		svn checkout http://svn.wxwidgets.org/svn/wx/wxWidgets/tags/WX_2_9_4 wxWidgets
	
	Open Windows SDK 6.1 CMD Shell:
		
		setenv /release /x86 /xp
		cd wxWidgets_Installation_Path
		cd build\msw
		nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=release

. Download and Install PHP sources

	NOTE: At time of writing compilation was tested against 
		  PHP 5.3.11 but it should work with almost any prior 
		  5.3.x version

	Download PHP 5:
	
		To check available versions for download:
		
			http://windows.php.net/download/ 
			
		Direct download link for 5.3.11:
		
			http://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-5.3.11-src.zip
			
	Create the directory:
		
		c:\php-sdk
	
	Download PHP 5 binary tools:
		
		http://windows.php.net/downloads/php-sdk/
	
	Extract the binary tools inside the directory c:\php-sdk leaving 
	you with:
	
		c:\php-sdk\bin
		c:\php-sdk\script
		
	Open the Windows SDK 6.1 CMD Shell and do the following:
		
		setenv /release /x86 /xp
		cd c:\php-sdk\
		bin\phpsdk_setvars.bat
		bin\phpsdk_buildtree.bat php53dev
		
	Extract the php source files and place them on:
	
		c:\php-sdk\php53dev\vc9\x86\php5.3.x
		
	Then compile the sources to see if everything is working:
	
		cd c:\php-sdk\php53dev\vc9\x86\php5.3.x
		buildconf
		configure --disable-all --disable-zts --enable-cli
		nmake

. Compile wxPHP

	Get wxPHP sources:
		
		git clone git@github.com:wxphp/wxphp.git wxphp
	
	Put the source code in the ext folder of your php build folder:
	
		c:\php-sdk\php53dev\vc9\x86\php5.3.x\ext\wxphp
		
	Make sure to read the README_MSW for some compilation
	and linking fixes
		
	Open the Windows SDK 6.1 CMD Shell and do the following:
	
		setenv /release /x86 /xp
		cd c:\php-sdk\
		bin\phpsdk_setvars.bat
		cd c:\php-sdk\php53dev\vc9\x86\php5.3.x
		buildconf
		configure --disable-all --disable-zts --enable-cli --with-wxwidgets=C:\wxWidgets_installation_path
		nmake
		
	Copy the resulting php_wxwidgets.dll file on the Release directory 
	to the php extensions directory of your current PHP 5 VC9 X86 Non 
	Thread Safety setup.

	If you want the wxWidget extension to be automatically loaded, 
	add the following lines to the end of your php.ini:
	
		[PHP_WXWIDGETS]
		extension=php_wxwidgets.dll

	
	

Building and Installing on Linux/Unix Environments
========================================================================

. Install C/C++ compilers and autoconf tools
	
	Ubuntu and Debian based distros:
		
		sudo apt-get install build-essential

. Compile wxWidgets library and development packages, currently we have
  tested with version 2.9.4
  
	NOTE: wxWebView, a web browser like control, was enabled on the
	wrapper, in order to compile wxWidgets with wxWebView support you
	will need to have libwebkitgtk development files and library. On ubuntu
	and debian based distros this could be done with:
	
		sudo apt-get install libwebkitgtk-dev

	Download wxWidgets tar file and uncompress it on your
	directory of choice or svn checkout with:
	
		svn checkout http://svn.wxwidgets.org/svn/wx/wxWidgets/tags/WX_2_9_4 wxWidgets
	
	On the console change to the wxWidgets directory and:
	
		./configure --prefix=/opt/wxWidgets
	
. Install php5 development packages 

	Ubuntu 10.04 (and most debian based distros):
		
		apt-get install php5-dev
	
. Configure and build the extension
	
	cd wxphp
	phpize
	./configure --with-wxwidgets=/opt/wxWidgets
	make
	
. Installing the extension
	
	After make a file named wxwidgets.so will be generated on the modules
	directory. You can reduce the file size by stripping debugging symbols
	by using the strip utility:
	
		strip modules/wxwidgets.so
		
	Then you can copy the resulting wxwidgets.so file on the modules 
    directory to the php extensions directory. PHP extensions directory 
    is usually found on /usr/lib/php5/ On ubuntu 10.04 - 11.10 this 
    directory is /usr/lib/php5/20090626/

    To automate the installation process just use:

        sudo make install
	
	If you want the wxWidget extension to be automatically loaded, add the
	following lines to your php.ini:
	
		; load php wxwidgets module
		extension=wxwidgets.so
		
	If not, then enable dynamic loading on your php.ini usually on:
		
		/etc/php5/cli/php.ini
		
		modify enable_dl = off to enable_dl = on
	



Creating a DEB Package
========================================================================

First ensure you are able to build with the linux building instructions.
Then in order to create a debian package you would need to first
compile wxWidgets with configure as:
	
		./configure --prefix=/opt/wxwidgets-php --enable-monolithic
		
		make 
		
		make install
		
After that, copy /opt/wxwidgets-php into the debian directory on the 
wxphp source tree, and at the wxphp source tree root execute:

		dpkg-buildpackage
		
That should take care of building and creating a deb package. We aren't
using upstream wxWidgets packages since they are sometimes compiled 
with less features and there aren't 2.9.4 packages of wxWidgets available
on ubuntu or debian repositories.




Linking statically to wxWidgets on Linux/Unix/MacOSX
========================================================================

Statically linking is a good idea to package wxphp into rmp/deb files without
dependencies on third party wxGTK packages that may be incompatible. On 
64 bits static linking is impossible without the use of -fPIC or so that
has been my experience, so here is the steps involved to achieve it.

1. Compile wxWidgets with -fPIC

	CFLAGS="-fPIC -O2 -Wall -W" CXXFLAGS="-fPIC -O2" \
	../configure --prefix=/opt/wxWidgets-static --disable-shared --enable-monolithic
	
2. Run the generated wxphp configure script with custom ld flags
	
	LDFLAGS="-L/opt/wxWidgets-static/lib -pthread -lwx_gtk2u-2.9 -lwx_gtk2u_gl-2.9 -lwxregexu-2.9 -lwxscintilla-2.9 -lwxtiff-2.9" \
	./configure --with-wxwidgets=/opt/wxWidgets-static --enable-wxwidgets-monolithic
	
3. Strip debugging symbols for smaller library size

	strip modules/wxwidgets.so
	
If a smaller library size is wanted it could be achieved by playing with 
the GCC optimization flags, when compiling the wxWidgets library on the 
first step as on the second step. Some flags that could reduce the file 
size (a little bit) of final libraries as increase performance could be 
-Os and -s for example: 
	
	CFLAGS="-fPIC -Os -s" CXXFLAGS="-fPIC -Os -s"




Building on MacOSX Lion
========================================================================

The process of building on mac is the same as on linux the only
differences are the way we configure wxWidgets build, as the applications
needed. We tested with the php version available on mac ports.

. Requirements
    
    Xcode (for working compiling environment)
		https://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/
    
    Mac Ports (for PHP development environment and binaries)
		http://www.macports.org/

. Install PHP from Mac Ports

    This process could take a long time since mac ports application
    downloads php sources and dependency sources and compiles.

        sudo port install php5

. Get wxWidgets sources and build

    svn checkout http://svn.wxwidgets.org/svn/wx/wxWidgets/tags/WX_2_9_4 wxWidgets

    cd wxWidgets

    mkdir mybuild

    cd mybuild

    ../configure -with-osx_cocoa --disable-compat24 --with-macosx-version-min=10.6 --with-macosx-sdk=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk --prefix=/opt/wxWidgets CFLAGS="-arch x86_64" CXXFLAGS="-arch x86_64" CPPFLAGS="-arch x86_64" LDFLAGS="-arch x86_64" OBJCFLAGS="-arch x86_64" OBJCXXFLAGS="-arch x86_64"

        Note: if non 64 bit architecture just remove the x86_64 flags

    make

    sudo make install

. Compile wxPHP as usual

    cd wxphp

    phpize

    ./configure --with-wxwidgets=/opt/wxWidgets

    make

    sudo make install




Running the examples
========================================================================

In order to run the examples provided you need to install php cli version.
On ubuntu this is done by running:

	sudo apt-get install php5-cli
	
To run the examples change on your console to the examples directory
and run the php interpreter on each file:

	php thread.php
		
on windows you can also do
	
	php-win thread.php




Third Party Tools
========================================================================

. wxFormBuilder - a RAD tool for wxWidgets GUI design.

	We worked on adding php support to this great forms designer.
	For more information visit the official website:
		
		http://wxformbuilder.org/
	
	Also You can find the latest nightly builds for windows with
	PHP support at:
	
		http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxformbuilder/files/
		
	Integration of PHP support wouldn't be possible without the help
	of RedTide and the rest of wxFormBuilder teams, Thanks a lot!
		
	


Development
========================================================================

For those interested on helping improve this extension this section 
explains the basics of how it works. Almost every subdirectory
contains a README file explaining its content so be sure to check them
all ;)

. Code is auto generated

	Almost all the wxPHP extension source code is generated by a set
	of php scripts except app.h, app.cpp, references.h and references.cpp.
	Even at a certain point config files are re-generated to include changes
	on the source files that need to be compiled. The PHP script that
	generates the source code uses as input the xml files produced by doxygen
	from the wxWidgets docs. This xml files are parsed by another tool 
	and then converted into json files for easy mapping into php arrays 
	using json_decode function.
	
. XML Parser

	On the xml_parser directory you will find the script on charge of
	parsing the xml files and converting them to json files. This
	script uses the xml files on the xml directory as input. In order 
	to regenerate this xml files with the most recent changes you would 
	need an svn trunk copy of wxWidgets then inside of the wxWidgets 
	directory:
	
		cd docs\doxygen
		./regen.sh xml
		
	This will produce hundreds of xml files that constitute the wxWidgets
	documentation. You would need to copy all the files on out/xml 
	to the xml directory on the root directory of wxPHP. After you run 
	the xml_parser script with:
	
		php tools/xml_parser.php
		
	Some json files will be generated on the json dir, this files are
	
		classes.json, consts.json, global_variables.json, typedef.json
		class_groups.json, enums.json, includes.json, class_variables.json,
		functions.json
	
	NOTE: For some other details check the README file on the xml_parser 
		  directory.

. Code Generator

	Inside tools/source_maker directory resides the php script in charge of
	all the C/C++ code generation (code_generator.php) that forms the wxPHP 
	extension. As said before this script depends on the json files 
	generated by xml_parser.php on json directory at root of wxPHP
	you will find a copy of all these files. The source maker will read 
	the json files and create a set of headers and source files wrapping
	the wxWidgets classes defined on classes.json
	
	It starts by decoding all json files and cleaning methods with 
	unsupported parameter types as other qualities not handled correctly 
	by the generator. All the cleaning activity is logged on a file 
	named discarded.log. Then it process each class using a semi-template
	system. The templates directory holds the source of what will form 
	the skeleton of the wrapping code.
	
	After generating the classes binding code it generates binding code
	to the global wxWidgets functions and store them on functions.cpp.
	Then it populates the files on source_templates directory with
	all the code needed to initialize each binded class, function, global
	variable, etc... At the final stage, it uses the config_templates
	directory to retrieve the configuration files skeleton and populate it
	with the list of files that need to be compiled.
	
	Use the go.sh/bat utility script to automate some of the steps necessary
	or build.sh script on the wxPHP root directory (linux only) to automate
	installation of the extension.
	
	NOTE: For more information about the code generator check the README 
		  file on tools/source_maker directory.
		  
. Class/Methods Selector

	An GUI utility on tools/source_maker/class_selector/selector.php was created
	using wxPHP itself in order to facilitate the selection of the class
	methods that are going to be binded. To use this utility you need to
	have a working wxPHP.
	
	This utility uses the file named full_classes_set.json that is actually
	a copy of the classes.json generated by the xml parser. When saving
	the selected methods it creates a file named classes.json that is the
	one actually used by the code generator. This file automatically replaces
	the one on dumps directory each time the go.sh/bat utility is ran to
	generate the code.

	NOTE: For more information about the utility check the README 
		  file on source_maker/class_selector directory.
